You are an expert React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui developer.

I already have a `ProductDetailsPage.jsx` and `CartDrawer.jsx` similar to the ones below (importing `Button`, `Sheet`, `Badge`, `Tabs`, etc.). 
I want you to now implement a **complete checkout flow** with proper navigation and UI consistency.

✅ Requirements:

1. **Button Integration & Navigation**
   - When user clicks **"Buy Now"** in `ProductDetailsPage`, add the item to cart and navigate directly to `/checkout`.
   - When user clicks **"Checkout"** in `CartDrawer`, also navigate to `/checkout`.
   - Navigation can use React Router (`useNavigate`) or custom context navigation (if already defined).

2. **Checkout Page (CheckoutPage.jsx)**
   - Create a new component `CheckoutPage`.
   - Keep UI consistent with the rest of the app (white background, Tailwind grid layout, rounded sections, subtle borders).
   - Divide into two sections:
     - **Left:** Address & Contact form
       - Full Name
       - Mobile Number
       - Email
       - Address Line 1
       - Address Line 2 (optional)
       - City
       - State
       - Zip Code
       - Country (dropdown)
     - **Right:** Order Summary
       - List all cart items (image, name, quantity, price)
       - Show subtotal, shipping (flat ₹50), total
       - "Pay Now" button at the bottom

3. **Form Handling**
   - Use `useState` for form inputs.
   - Validate required fields (show toast or inline error if empty).

4. **Dummy Razorpay Payment Gateway**
   - When “Pay Now” button is clicked:
     - Validate form
     - Then open a **modal dialog box** (styled like Razorpay)
       - Title: “Razorpay Secure Payment”
       - Show total amount, UPI / Card / Wallet options (just buttons, no real logic)
       - “Pay ₹xxxx” button (simulated)
     - On clicking “Pay ₹xxxx”, close modal and show success toast: “Payment Successful!”

5. **Navigation After Payment**
   - After success, navigate to `/order-success` page that shows:
     - A green checkmark icon
     - Message: “Your order has been placed successfully!”
     - Button: “Continue Shopping” → navigates back to home

6. **Styling**
   - Use Tailwind + shadcn/ui components (Card, Input, Button, etc.)
   - Keep consistent padding, rounded corners (`rounded-2xl`), and clean spacing.
   - Responsive for mobile & desktop.

7. **Extra Details**
   - Add shipping icons (Truck, Shield, RefreshCw) in checkout summary footer to match product details style.
   - Ensure total updates dynamically from cart context.
   - Reuse `useCart()` context for fetching cart data & total.

🧩 Deliverables:
- `CheckoutPage.jsx`
- Optional: `OrderSuccessPage.jsx`
- Updated navigation integration in:
  - `CartDrawer.jsx` → on Checkout click
  - `ProductDetailsPage.jsx` → on Buy Now click

🎯 Goal:
After implementing this, I should be able to:
- Add products to cart
- Open cart drawer
- Click checkout → go to checkout page
- Fill form → click Pay Now → see dummy Razorpay dialog → success message → continue shopping.
