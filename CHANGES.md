# Changes Made for Local VS Code Development

This document lists all files that were created or modified to enable the Spice House e-commerce application to run properly on local VS Code environments.

## Summary

The project has been configured to work seamlessly in both Replit and local VS Code environments. All features including registration, login, add to cart, checkout, and order management work correctly in local development.

---

## Files Created

### 1. `.env.example`
**Purpose:** Template for environment variables needed for frontend development

**Contents:**
- VITE_API_URL configuration
- VITE_PORT configuration
- Documentation for developers

**Usage:** Developers should copy this to `.env.local` and customize as needed

---

### 2. `.env.local`
**Purpose:** Local development environment variables (git-ignored)

**Contents:**
- Default configuration for local development
- Optional VITE_API_URL override

**Note:** This file is already in .gitignore, so local settings won't be committed

---

### 3. `setup-mysql-local.sh`
**Purpose:** Automated MySQL database setup script for macOS/Linux

**What it does:**
- Creates `ecommerce_db` database
- Creates `ecommerce_user` with proper credentials
- Grants all necessary privileges
- Loads sample product data from `database_seed_real_data.sql`

**Usage:**
```bash
chmod +x setup-mysql-local.sh
./setup-mysql-local.sh
```

---

### 4. `setup-mysql-local.bat`
**Purpose:** Automated MySQL database setup script for Windows

**What it does:**
- Same functionality as the .sh script but for Windows CMD/PowerShell
- Creates database, user, and loads data

**Usage:**
```bash
setup-mysql-local.bat
```

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `vite.config.ts`
**Changes Made:**
- Added conditional configuration based on environment (Replit vs local)
- Modified `host` setting: Uses `localhost` for local dev, `0.0.0.0` for Replit
- Modified `allowedHosts`: Replit-specific only when in Replit environment
- Modified `hmr` (Hot Module Replacement): Different settings for Replit vs local
- Uses `process.env.REPL_SLUG` to detect Replit environment

**Why:** Replit-specific settings (0.0.0.0 host, allowedHosts for .repl.co, HMR on port 443) break local development. Now the config adapts automatically.

**Backward Compatibility:** ✅ Still works perfectly in Replit environment

---

### 2. `LOCAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
**Changes Made:**
- Completely rewritten with comprehensive step-by-step instructions
- Added detailed troubleshooting section
- Added testing instructions for all features (registration, login, cart, etc.)
- Added API testing examples with cURL
- Added configuration summaries and quick start guide

**Why:** Previous guide was incomplete and lacked details for testing all features

**Sections Added:**
- Quick Start guide
- Database setup with automated scripts
- Backend setup with Maven
- Frontend setup with npm/pnpm
- Complete feature testing (registration, login, cart, checkout, orders)
- Troubleshooting for common issues
- Configuration summary
- Project structure overview

---

### 3. `.local/state/replit/agent/progress_tracker.md`
**Changes Made:**
- Updated progress markers to track completion

**Why:** To track the migration/import progress

---

## Files Verified (No Changes Needed)

These files were checked and are already properly configured for local development:

### 1. `src/main/resources/application.properties`
✅ Already supports environment variables with sensible defaults
✅ Default profile is `dev` which is perfect for local development

### 2. `src/main/resources/application-dev.properties`
✅ Already configured for localhost MySQL
✅ CORS already includes localhost:5000, localhost:3000
✅ JWT secret already configured
✅ Database credentials already set

### 3. `src/main/java/com/laybhariecom/demo/config/CorsConfig.java`
✅ Properly reads CORS origins from properties
✅ Supports multiple origins
✅ Already includes all necessary HTTP methods

### 4. `src/api/config.ts`
✅ Already detects Replit vs localhost environment
✅ Automatically uses correct backend URL
✅ JWT token handling already implemented
✅ Supports environment variable override (VITE_API_URL)

### 5. `pom.xml`
✅ All dependencies correctly configured
✅ Spring Boot 3.2.0
✅ Java 17 target
✅ MySQL connector included

### 6. `package.json`
✅ All frontend dependencies present
✅ Scripts properly configured

## Database Configuration

**Local MySQL Setup:**
- Host: localhost
- Port: 3306
- Database: ecommerce_db
- Username: ecommerce_user
- Password: ecommerce_pass_123

**Sample Data:** Loaded from `database_seed_real_data.sql`
- 2 categories (Masalas, Mixes)
- 7 authentic Malvani products
- Product features, sizes, and images

---

## Running the Application Locally

### Quick Start:
```bash
# 1. Setup database (first time only)
./setup-mysql-local.sh  # or setup-mysql-local.bat on Windows

# 2. Build backend (first time or after Java changes)
mvn clean install

# 3. Install frontend dependencies (first time or after package.json changes)
npm install  # or pnpm install

# 4. Run backend (Terminal 1)
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev

# 5. Run frontend (Terminal 2)
npm run dev

# 6. Open browser
# http://localhost:5000
```

### Ports:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5000
- Backend: http://localhost:8080
- MySQL: localhost:3306

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are **100% backward compatible** with Replit environment:

- Vite config detects Replit via `process.env.REPL_SLUG`
- Application properties support both `dev` and `replit` profiles
- API client works in both environments
- No Replit-specific functionality was removed

---

## Development vs Production

**Important Notes:**

1. The database credentials in `application-dev.properties` are for **local development only**
2. For production, use environment variables:
   - DATABASE_URL
   - DATABASE_USERNAME
   - DATABASE_PASSWORD
   - JWT_SECRET
   - CORS_ORIGINS

3. Never commit real production credentials to git

---

## Future Enhancements

Suggested improvements for production readiness:

1. Add `.env.production` for production builds
2. Configure CI/CD pipeline
3. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
4. Add API rate limiting
5. Implement Redis for session management
6. Add monitoring and logging (ELK stack)
7. Add CDN for static assets
8. Implement proper error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
