### 🧾 Required Changes:

1. **Scale Up Card Boxes**
   - Slightly increase the size (padding, font, and overall height) of both:
     - "Delivery Information"
     - "Order Summary"
   - Use: `p-8`, `text-base`, and `rounded-2xl shadow-sm` for both.
   - Keep responsive design intact.

2. **In-Card Titles**
   - Move headings **inside** the card content (as soft hint titles).
   - Example: Instead of a `CardHeader` title, show:
     - “Delivery Information” → as `p-2 text-gray-500 font-medium text-sm` at the top inside the card.
     - Same for “Order Summary”.

3. **State → City Dropdown Logic**
   - Replace text inputs for “State” and “City” with **two dependent dropdown menus**.
   - Implement:
     - A `Select` for **State** containing all **Indian states** (Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, etc.).
     - Once the user selects a state, the **City** dropdown populates dynamically with that state’s major cities.
   - Disable the city dropdown until a state is selected.
   - Example structure:
     ```jsx
     const stateCityData = {
       Maharashtra: ["Mumbai", "Pune", "Nagpur", "Nashik"],
       Gujarat: ["Ahmedabad", "Surat", "Vadodara", "Rajkot"],
       Karnataka: ["Bengaluru", "Mysuru", "Mangaluru"],
       // ... all Indian states
     };
     ```
   - Use `Select` components from shadcn/ui for both.

4. **Add Payment Method Section (Below Address Form)**
   - At the bottom of the left column (after address inputs), create a new section:
     - Title: “Payment Method”
     - Two options as **radio buttons**:
       - (A) Razorpay / UPI / Cards
       - (B) Cash on Delivery (COD)
     - Store selected option in a state: `paymentMethod`.
     - Default: Razorpay.
     - Use Tailwind for nice spacing (`flex items-center gap-3 mt-4`).

5. **Move Pay Button**
   - Remove the **Pay Now** button from inside the **Order Summary** card.
   - Instead, place it **below the Payment Section** (end of left column).
   - Logic:
     - If `paymentMethod === "razorpay"` → show button text: `Pay Now ₹{total}`
     - If `paymentMethod === "cod"` → show button text: `Place Order`
     - Keep same black styling (`bg-black hover:bg-gray-800`).
     - Keep validation and success logic same.
     - On COD click → directly navigate to success page with toast “Order placed successfully via COD!”

6. **Add Coupon / Discount Box**
   - In **Order Summary**, above the Subtotal section:
     - Add an input + button row for coupons:
       - Placeholder: “Enter coupon or discount code”
       - Button: “Apply”
       - On click → show toast:
         - If input is empty → “Please enter a valid coupon code.”
         - If entered → “Coupon applied successfully! (10% off)” and adjust total price (reduce by 10%).
       - Use Tailwind grid or flex for clean layout:
         ```jsx
         <div className="flex gap-2">
           <Input placeholder="Enter coupon code" value={coupon} onChange={(e) => setCoupon(e.target.value)} />
           <Button onClick={applyCoupon}>Apply</Button>
         </div>
         ```

---

### ⚙️ Behavioral Flow After Changes:
- User fills Delivery + selects State → City auto-fills accordingly.
- Chooses payment option (Razorpay / COD).
- Sees total in Order Summary.
- If Razorpay selected → “Pay Now ₹xxx”.
- If COD selected → “Place Order”.
- Coupon can reduce total dynamically.
- Everything else (toast, validation, navigation, RazorpayModal) must keep working.
