You are a senior full-stack architect helping me transition my e-commerce web app from demo data to a production-ready structure.

The project has:

✅ Frontend (React or similar — already built)

✅ Backend (Spring Boot or Node.js — already built)

✅ Database (MySQL or MongoDB — already connected)

1️⃣ Objective

I’ve been using demo data until now. I want to remove all demo/test data and insert real data directly into the database (through SQL/Seeder/Script).

The real-world data is as follows:

Categories:

Masalas

Mixes

Masala Products (3):

Malvani Masala

Malvani Garam Masala

Malvani Fish Masala

Mixes Products (4):

Kuldachi Pithi

Tandlache Pith

Tandlahi Bhakri Pith

Ghavne Pith

Use no demo images — just text data. All products should be hardcoded or seeded directly into the database initially.

2️⃣ Architecture Documentation Needed

Show me a clear architecture diagram or explanation of how the frontend, backend, and database interact.

Explain how this structure can be cloud-native and future-ready for hosting on a real domain (e.g., using AWS, Render, or Vercel).

Include folder structure (for both frontend & backend).

3️⃣ Workflow Plan

Explain clearly:

Step 1 → Setting up clean database (removing demo data).

Step 2 → Seeding new real data.

Step 3 → Integrating seeded data with frontend (API endpoints).

Step 4 → Testing all main functionalities end-to-end.

4️⃣ Functionalities Checklist

By looking at current code (you will analyze it), list which core e-commerce functionalities are:

✅ Already implemented and working

⚙️ Partially done

❌ Missing (need to be added)

This includes:

User login/signup

Product listing (categories, filters, etc.)

Cart & checkout

Order history

Admin panel

User profile

Payments (if integrated or pending)

5️⃣ Deliverables

Database script with the 2 categories & 7 products

API testing plan (Postman collection or endpoints list)

Cloud-ready configuration advice (CORS, environment variables, build setup, etc.)

Pending functionality report

Steps to deploy on a real domain later
